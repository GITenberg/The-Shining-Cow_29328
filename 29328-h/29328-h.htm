<div class="bk1"><p><i><small>This is NOT a story about sinister aliens from outer space. This is
simply the story of what happened to poor Junius when she found herself
much too close to a Flying Saucer, long enough so she could be analyzed
and long enough to cause some strange happenings on that farm.</small></i></p></div>

<p class="pr1"><big><b>Robbie whined and acted like his eyes were burning, as if
he'd gotten dust or something even stranger into them....</b></big></p></div>

<p><span class="dcap">Zack Stewart</span> stared
sleepily into the bottom of
his cracked coffee cup as his
wife began to gather the
breakfast dishes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stewart was a huge,
methodical woman, seasoned
to the drudgery of a farm
wife. Quite methodically
she'd arise every morning at
4:00 A.M. with her husband
and each would do their respective
chores until long
after the sun had set on their
forty-acre farm.</p>

<p>"You've jest got to find
Junius today, Zack," Mrs.
Stewart spoke worriedly,
"Lord only knows her condition,
not being milked since
yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know, Ma," Zack
said wearily as he rose from
the table, "I'll search for her
again in the north woods, but
if she ain't there this time, I
give up."</p>

<p>A dog suddenly howled
outside. There was a brief instant
when neither moved,
then Zack suddenly exclaimed,
"It's Robbie!" and
dashed outside.</p>

<p>In the light from the open
doorway Zack saw the dog
creeping along on his haunches,
howling and whining, and
scratching frantically at his
tear-streaming eyes.</p>

<p>"Skunk finally got ya, eh
boy?" Zack spoke sympathetically
as the dog, fawning,
came closer.</p>

<p>"Stay away, Robbie, stay
away now!" he ordered the
dog. Robbie whined and
scratched again, furiously.
Zack sniffed cautiously, expecting
any moment the pungent
smell of skunk fluid to
hit his nostrils. He sensed
nothing but the clean, fresh
smell of the morning air, so
he leaned closer. Within a
foot of Robbie, he sniffed
again. Nothing. He realized it
wasn't a skunk that caused
Robbie's eyes to burn. He
knelt down and took the dog's
head tenderly in his rough,
calloused hands and examined
his eyes. They were bloodshot
and watery. He took some
water from the well and
dashed it into the dog's eyes
as Robbie struggled.</p>

<p>"Hold still, boy, I'm trying
to help ya," Zack soothed. He
took out a blue work bandanna
and wiped tenderly around
Robbie's eyes.</p>

<p>"What did it, boy? How did
it happen?" Zack asked. Robbie
merely whined.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with him?"
Mrs. Stewart, broom in hand,
asked from the doorway.</p>

<p>"Don't rightly know," Zack
patted the dog, "acts like he
got something in his eyes."</p>

<p>"Skunk?"</p>

<p>"Naw," Zack shook his
head. "He don't smell. Something
else."</p>

<p>"Cat?"</p>

<p>"No scratches, either. He
acts like they're burnin' him,
like he got dust or somethin'
in 'em."</p>

<p>"Well, take him out to the
barn and you better get after
Junius."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Ma. Come on, Robbie."
He led Robbie to the
barn and made him lie on a
bed of hay in one of the stalls
then returned to the kitchen
for his lantern. He put on his
thick denim jacket and work
cap and turned to his wife.</p>

<p>"If she ain't in the woods,
I'll come back and git the
truck and drive over to the
Leemers and see if he seen
her."</p>

<p>He left the kitchen and
shone the lantern around in
the farmyard to get his bearings,
then headed for the
north end of his farm. He
could see the faint glimmer of
dawn in the east, more pronounced
in the northeast, and
even more so due north. He
rubbed his eyes. A much
brighter glow outlined the
treetops in the north woods,
that made the dawn on the
eastern horizon look like a
dirty gray streak. His first
thought was of fire, but there
was no smoke, no flame.</p>

<p>Zack walked dazedly toward
the woods, his eyes
glued to the light above the
trees. Soon he was in the
woods, and he could see the
brightness extended down
through the trees from the
sky, on the other side of the
woods. He approached cautiously
as the light grew
brighter, and came to the
clearing where it was most intense.
A thick bush obstructed
his view, and Zack moved
it aside then uttered a hoarse
gasp, as he clutched at his
eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment he felt he
was dreaming. He squinted
between the slits of his fingers.
The glow was still piercing,
but he could see the
brightly lit Junius, radiating
blue-white light, nibbling at
the sparse grass in the clearing.
Zack stood transfixed,
his eyes widening behind his
fingers. He felt the tears and
the burning sensation, and
squinted tightly, turning his
head from the unbelievable
scene.</p>

<hr />

<p>Zack didn't remember his
return to the farmhouse, or
incoherently trying to explain
to his wife the scene he
had witnessed. A stiff jolt of
elderberry wine drove off the
jitters and reasoning returned.
His wife sat patiently,
eyeing him oddly, as Zack
muttered over and over again,
"It's unbelievable! It's unbelievable!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stewart rose. "I'm going
out and see fer myself.
And, Zack, if yer lying to
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Zack jumped from the
chair, barring her way.</p>

<p>"Believe me, maw, it's true.
Don't go out there. It might
be too much fer ya."</p>

<p>"It's the craziest thing I
ever heard," Mrs. Stewart
scoffed. "A cow that shines
like the sun!"</p>

<p>"Look, maw, will ya jest
come with me as fer as the
pasture, you can see the glow
from there, and mebbe that
might convince ya."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will." Mrs.
Stewart jerked off her apron.
"I declare, Zack, I think these
chores are getting the best of
ya."</p>

<p>They walked to the pasture,
their eyes on the treetops of
the north woods. A faint glow
began to appear.</p>

<p>"See! See!" Zack pointed,
laughing crazily.</p>

<p>"Let's get closer, looks like
a fire," Mrs. Stewart said.</p>

<p>"Ain't no fire." Zack's tone
was angry. "It's Junius and
she's all lit up like a Christmas
tree."</p>

<p>"Zack, now you stop that
kinda crazy talk. There's a
reason behind everything,
and I'm sure there's one fer
this."</p>

<p>"There is a reason, maw.
Junius. She's got the whole
clearing lit up like the noonday
sun. Lord only knows
how she got that way, but
she's shining out there like a
great big light bulb, only
brighter."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stewart quickened her
pace towards the clearing.</p>

<p>"I'm going to see fer myself,"
she said determinedly,
"and put an end to this foolish
nonsense."</p>

<p>"Alright, maw," Zack spoke
resignedly, "if yer mind's set.
But I'm warning ya, ya better
squint yer eyes tight. She's
too bright to look at. Poor
Robbie must have got too
good a look at her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stewart approached
the clearing ahead of her husband,
and moved the same bush
aside that had obstructed her
husband's view. Her gaze
caught the brightly radiating
figure of Junius, and Mrs.
Stewart screamed, clasping
her face with her hands. Zack
had his head turned, but he
groped for his wife, grasped
her arm and led her from the
clearing.</p>

<p>"It's too crazy to believe,
Zack," she whispered in awe;
"What are we going to do?
What has happened to poor
Junius?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what happened
to her," Zack answered,
"but I know what
I'm going to do about it. I'm
going to call the University
and git them scientist fellas
down here."</p>

<p>"You suppose they can git
close enough to milk the poor
thing?" Mrs. Stewart clasped
her hands in frustration.
"She's probably in misery."</p>

<p>Zack shook his head. "Ain't
no tellin' what they're liable
to do after they seen her.
Most likely they'll want to
ship her to the University to
examine her and see how she
got that way."</p>

<p>"Why don't we call the
Vet'nar'n?" Mrs. Stewart
asked. "It might be some kind
of new disease."</p>

<p>"It ain't no disease, maw.
It's something nobody in the
whole world ever seen or
heard of before. I jest hope I
can convince them University
fellas to come down here."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you better
tie Junius so she won't
stray?"</p>

<p>"Better wait and see what
them scientists say. Besides,
if she strays, all we gotta
do is follow the light!"</p>

<hr />

<p>Zack did the most important
chores and at eight A.M.
on the dot he called the
State University.</p>

<p>The operator at the switchboard
answered sleepily.</p>

<p>"Good morning, State University."</p>

<p>"Mornin', ma'am. I'd like to
talk to one of them scientist
fellas."</p>

<p>"To whom in particular did
you wish to speak?"</p>

<p>"Any of 'em that ain't busy.
I got somethin' important to
tell 'em."</p>

<p>"If I knew what it was
about," the operator was becoming
irritated, "I'd connect
you with the right
party."</p>

<p>Zack hesitated, reluctant to
give his startling news to a
mere operator. Instead, he
hedged. "Well, who would
have charge of things that
light up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you want the electrical
engineering lab. Just a
moment, sir."</p>

<p>There was a series of clicks
and buzzes in the earpiece
then Zack heard a man's deep
voice.</p>

<p>"Hello."</p>

<p>"Hello," Zack replied, "this
the electrical engineering
lab?"</p>

<p>"Yessir, that's right."</p>

<p>"Well, my name is Zack
Stewart and I own a forty-acre
farm on the Canal Road
just outside of Smithville."</p>

<p>"I'm Professor Donnell, can
I help you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Zack took a deep
breath then began, "my cow
Junius was missing since
yesterday morning and this
morning when I went out to
search for her again, I found
her."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stewart," Professor
Donnell's voice was impatient,
"I'm a very busy man
with a heavy class schedule.
Why in the world would I
care if you found your cow
or not?"</p>

<p>"You'd care if you knew
how I found her."</p>

<p>"Alright, Mr. Stewart, how
did you find your cow, with
some new kind of radar?"</p>

<p>"Nossir, I found her by
following the bright light in
the north wood and when I
got there, there was Junius
lit up like a neon sign."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stewart, are you
drunk?"</p>

<p>"I knew you wouldn't believe
me. All I can say is,
come see for&mdash;"</p>

<p>Zack heard a sudden click
then an immediate buzzing.
Professor Donnell had hung
up.</p>

<hr />

<p>He had no sooner replaced
the phone when there was a
pounding on the door. He
opened it and saw six state
troopers and four important-looking
gentlemen in civilian
dress. A trooper who looked
as though he might be in
charge, spoke to Zack.</p>

<p>"Sir, we don't want you or
your wife to get panicky, but
we have reason to believe
that something strange is going
on in your woods. These
men are from the atomic research
laboratory at the University
and they are convinced
that a flying saucer
has landed out there."</p>

<p>"It ain't no flying saucer,"
Zack spoke wearily.</p>

<p>"It isn't?" one of the gentlemen
asked, disappointed,
"then what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's Junius, my cow."</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;WHAT?" the state
trooper exclaimed incredulously.
"Are you nuts?"</p>

<p>Angrily, Zack jerked his
thumb in the direction of the
north woods.</p>

<p>"Jest go out there and see
fer yourself and then tell me
I'm nuts."</p>

<p>They hurriedly left the
house, looking back skeptically
at Zack.</p>

<p>Zack and his wife stood in
the doorway, watching them
until they were out of sight
in the woods.</p>

<p>"You watch 'em come
busting back here in a
minute, maw."</p>

<p>In a few moments they saw
the men scrambling out of
the woods, rushing madly for
the house, holding their eyes.</p>

<p>"Now I don't have to convince
anybody," Zack
smirked.</p>

<p>By the time they reached
the porch, they were all talking
excitedly and rubbing
their eyes. The state trooper
in charge pulled Zack aside.</p>

<p>"Mister," he asked ominously,
"what the hell happened
to that cow?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Zack spoke
with sarcasm, "jest the way
I found her."</p>

<p>The important-looking civilian
bustled past the patrolman
and confronted Zack.</p>

<p>"I'd like to use your
phone," his hands moved
nervously, "where is it?"</p>

<p>Zack showed him and the
man rushed to it and hastily
dialed a number.</p>

<p>"This is Professor Jonathon
Sims, Nuclear Physicist
at State University. Put me
through immediately to the
Governor. It's very important."</p>

<p>There was a slight pause
as Sims drummed impatiently
on the phone.</p>

<p>"Hello! Hello, Governor?
Professor Sims. I'd like a
contingent of National
Guardsmen around the farm
of Zack Stewart on the old
Canal Road. A most astounding
thing has happened out here.
For the welfare of the Public,
I urgently request
this farm be placed under
tight security check at once
and the Federal Government
notified immediately."</p>

<p>"Hey now, wait a minute,
Mister&mdash;" Zack protested.</p>

<p>Sims motioned him into
silence, his ear glued to the
phone.</p>

<p>"Sir," he hesitated, glancing
at the group sideways,
"you won't believe this until
you see it. But we have positive
proof a saucer has landed
here. Mr. Stewart's cow is
radiating intense blue and
white light, the kind that has
been associated with the glow
of flying saucers."</p>

<p>Sims paused, listening to
the Governor. Zack saw him
fidget and stick a forefinger
in his collar.</p>

<p>"Honestly, Sir! I am not
drunk! The cow is radiating
light."</p>

<p>"See?" Zack grinned at
him. "Now ya know how I
felt."</p>

<p>Sims ignored him, concentrating
on the phone.</p>

<p>"Yessir, there is a state
trooper here." He turned
to the one in charge. "He
wants to speak to you." The
trooper took the receiver.</p>

<p>"Hello, Governor. Sgt. Les
Johnson of the Highway Patrol."
Pause. "That's right, sir.
There's a number of people
here who can swear to it.
Yessir." This time the trooper
fidgeted. "I seen it too.
Blue-white light, yessir. Nossir,
we are not having a drinking
party. The light was reported
by the pilot of the
Continental Airways early
this morning and we investigated.
Yessir." He held the
receiver towards Sims. "He
wants to talk to you again."</p>

<p>The Governor was finally
convinced something indeed
strange was happening at the
Stewart place, but being a
solid citizen and faithful servant
of the people who elected
him, he couldn't believe
the fantastic story the professor
and the trooper told
him. He decided to see for
himself and rang for his
chauffeur after his telephone
conversation with Professor
Sims.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Stewart
turned to Sims.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell us if
Junius can be milked?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know yet,
Mrs. Stewart. I'll have to investigate
the area for harmful
radio-activity first, then
I'll have to check the cow,
herself. Pardon me." He
turned to the phone again.</p>

<p>Trying to keep his voice
and emotion under control,
Professor Sims called his
laboratory at the University
and ordered among other
technical equipment, a Geiger
counter, a gamma-ray detector,
a portable lead shield,
body and temperature thermometers,
a portable X-ray machine,
and a dozen pairs of
smoked glasses.</p>

<p>The equipment arrived
within the hour, and Professor
Sims distributed it among
his assistants with his instructions.
It was understood that
he alone would approach
Junius, wearing his smoked
glasses and carrying the protective
lead shield, to make
the initial test. If his tests
proved that Junius could be
safely approached, he would
go back for the others.</p>

<p>"You look like one of them
flying saucer fellas, yerself,"
Zack laughed, seeing Professor
Sims donned in the lead
shield and the dark glasses.</p>

<p>Sims waved at the crowd in
the farmyard and walked awkwardly
toward the glow in
the north wood, less pronounced
now in the daylight.
They watched until his retreating
figure disappeared
into the woods, and they were
still watching the spot for
what seemed a long time
afterward. One of the assistants
fidgeted and looked at
his watch.</p>

<p>"He's been in there twenty
minutes. Wonder what he's
doing?"</p>

<p>"I hope he's milking her,"
Mrs. Stewart said hopefully.</p>

<p>Zack chuckled as a thought
struck him.</p>

<p>"What's so funny, Zack?"
his wife asked.</p>

<p>"Junius," Zack's chuckle
bubbled into laughter, "will
be the first cow to give radiated
milk."</p>

<hr />

<p>Finally, after another fifteen
minutes, they saw Professor
Sims emerge from the
woods. As he came across the
pasture they could see that
his smoked glasses were
propped above his eyebrows
and he was concentrating on
a small notebook in his hand,
shaking his head from time
to time.</p>

<p>When he finally joined the
waiting group, he was flooded
with questions.</p>

<p>He gestured them into silence.</p>

<p>"Please, I cannot answer
any questions as yet until I
have consulted with my assistants.
Sgt. Johnson, will
you please have your men
guard the clearing while we
hold a conference?"</p>

<p>"Is it safe to get that close
to her?" the trooper asked,
unbelieving.</p>

<p>"I can assure you that it is.
There is just a negligible
amount of radio-activity present,
and no more ultra-violet
rays then there are in an
average sun lamp. But you
must wear your glasses."
Turning to his aides he said,
"Come gentlemen," and they
followed him into the farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Can she be milked?" Mrs.
Stewart wailed after them.</p>

<p>"What a gadawful situation,"
Zack muttered, grabbing
a pitchfork and heading
for the barn.</p>

<p>The scientists seated themselves
around the big dining-room
table and faced Professor
Sims.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, it's the most
amazing thing that ever happened.
That cow is glowing
out there like a miniature
atomic pile, and under the
circumstances as we know
them, should be deader than
a door nail, but there she
stands, shining like the morning
sun, chewing her cud and
just mooing away as if nothing
happened."</p>

<p>"What is your theory, Professor?"
one of the assistants
asked.</p>

<p>"I have one, but it's utterly
fantastic," Sims answered.</p>

<p>"So is that cow out there.
Let's hear it!"</p>

<p>"Do you remember how
much more frequent saucer
sightings were reported in
this area alone?" Sims asked.
All the assistants nodded
their heads.</p>

<p>"Well," Sims went on, "I
am of the opinion that a saucer
actually landed out there
and they came across the cow
by accident. They either shot
her with some sort of radium
ray gun, or some luminous
substance unknown to us."</p>

<p>"Why didn't Junius die?"
one of the assistants asked.</p>

<p>Sims shook his head. "They
wished to examine her. You
see, gentlemen, whatever it
was, it served a threefold purpose.
It made her luminous,
immobile and&mdash;" Sims placed
both hands on the table and
leaned forward for emphasis,
"transparent."</p>

<p>There was a gasp and exclamations.</p>

<p>"Transparent? How?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was within a foot of the
cow, felt her hide, and
through the glasses I could
see the skeletal frame, the
chest cavity, the heart beating
within, the entire intestinal
tract, much, much more
clearly than could be seen by
the best X-ray."</p>

<p>As if on command, the assistants
all rose simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Sit down, gentlemen, the
cow isn't going anywhere.
We shall have to face this
situation with sound scientific
reasoning. There will be
a closed van here soon to pick
up Junius and haul her to the
laboratory where we can examine
her more thoroughly.
Now my belief is that the
saucer took off in haste, such
great haste that they forgot
to extinguish poor Junius. I
believe they will be back
looking for her, therefore we
shall have to return her tonight
and conceal ourselves
around the area and watch."</p>

<p>"Splendid idea, Professor
Sims!" one of the assistants
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Yelling voices in the farmyard
caught their attention.
They saw Sgt. Johnson
through the dining-room window,
coming across the yard,
yelling and pointing to the
sky. Sims rushed from the
house, met Johnson, grasped
him by the shoulders, shaking
him.</p>

<p>"What happened, man,
what happened?" Sims asked.</p>

<p>"Black light, black light!"
Johnson shouted, pointing
skyward. Sims looked up.
Nothing but the serene blue
of the summer sky and an
occasional bird caught his
eye.</p>

<p>Sims shook him again,
more roughly.</p>

<p>"Speak, man, what happened?"</p>

<p>"Black light flashed down
on the cow! Blackest light
you ever saw!"</p>

<p>The group gathered around
him in the yard, trying to
make sense out of what he
said. So engrossed were they
with his babblings, that none
but Mrs. Stewart was aware
of the fact that Junius had
entered the farmyard and was
eyeing them curiously.</p>

<p>"Junius!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Moooo!"</p>

<p>The crowd looked up to see
the ordinary, unlit Junius
standing calmly by the gate.</p>

<p>"Hurry and get the milk
pail, Zack, Junius is all right
now!" Mrs. Stewart yelled
happily to her husband, as
Professor Sims and his assistants
led the hysterical trooper
into the house.</p>

<p>High over the horizon, a
faint, silvery disc was disappearing
at fantastic speed
into outer space.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
